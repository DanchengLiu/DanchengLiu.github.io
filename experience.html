                                ASAP, Auto Scheduler Assist Program, is a website that aims to reduce workload for UCSD students
                                during the course selection process. ASAP allows the students to input a list of classes and classify them
                                as must-takes or want-to-takes and then generates the optimized schedule according to user preferences

                                Researched on the relationship between COVID-19 and people's mental health status, focusing on the change of depression and anxiety
                                level before and during COVID-19 pandemic.
                            </li>

                                As the team leader and a main contributor, I organized the research, found datasets based on group proposal, and performed analysis between
                                two datasets.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Formed a report, concluding that depression and anxiety level rises significantly during COVID-19 pandemic.

                        <li>
                            Collaborated with graduate researcher Kazim Ergun, under the supervision of Professor Tajana Rosing,
                            to conduct research on methodologies of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing reliability on
                            edge devices in IoT systems
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Proposed to use a novel dynamic reliability management (DRM) technique to solve the problem
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Designed “no ERC-ETC” approach and analyzed prior works with a focus on DREAM architecture

                        <li>
                            Used DREAM as a comparison to the final solution, which should significantly reduce energy
                            consumption and increase reliability for edge devices in IoT systems with multiple devices while
                            maintaining QoS constraints
